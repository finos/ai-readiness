title: Reputational Risk

---

- AI failures or misuse can quickly become public incidents, eroding trust.  
- Customer-facing GenAI (e.g., chatbots) can generate offensive, inaccurate, or unfair content.  
- Bad press and reputational damage can result from AI-driven unfair treatment or errors.  
- Compliance failures linked to AI can lead to regulatory fines and scrutiny.  
- The financial sector relies on trust—AI mistakes can severely impact a firm’s reputation.  
- High-profile errors, such as biased loan denials or flawed investor reports, can be damaging.  
- Regulators have flagged AI-related reputational risk as a key concern.  
- Firms must recognize that AI-driven services reflect on their overall conduct.  
- AI can scale errors rapidly, potentially sending flawed messages to thousands of customers.  
- Reputation damage from AI mistakes is a significant operational risk.
